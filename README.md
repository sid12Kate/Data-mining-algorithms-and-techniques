# Data-mining-algorithms-and-techniques

In today's data driven industry, various multiple tools are available at hand for studying data, gaining insights and putting all of them to right use. Weka is one such tool that can be used for data mining purposes. This project has various subparts such as classification, clustering, time series forecasting etc. Different datasets are used so that they can suit the respective goal that has to be achieved for that particular subpart. I have also written a detailed data analysis report that specifies my results and gained insights. However the arff format is currently not supported by github, please go through the " Results, Findings and Insights " document for a clearer idea of the project.
